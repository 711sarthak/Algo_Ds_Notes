The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, 
and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F<sub>n</sub>, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
